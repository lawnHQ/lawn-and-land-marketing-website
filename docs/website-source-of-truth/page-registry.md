# Page Registry

Status key
- developed = real body content and strategic substance
- scaffolded = live shell with limited content depth
- planned = approved but not live
- killed = intentionally removed from scope
- legacy = non-canonical route still present or still leaking through links

## Killed / Non-Canonical / Legacy
| Type | Route | Current State | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| killed | `/services/` | Returns 404 / intentionally retired | Keep removed from internal linking and do not reintroduce as canonical |
| killed | `/pricing/` | Returns 404 / retired | Remove lingering references and do not reintroduce as canonical page |
| killed | `/resources/guides/` | Page file deleted and removed from internal structure | Keep retired unless explicitly brought back with a new decision |
| legacy | `/resources/contact/` | Page file deleted; internal uses replaced | Continue using `/contact/` only |
| legacy | `/services/...` child routes | Internal uses replaced with `/marketing-services/...` equivalents | Keep retired and redirect later only if needed |
| legacy | older orphan routes like `/team/`, `/results/`, `/good-fit/`, `/book/`, old article URLs | Internal uses removed or replaced in the route-hygiene pass | Keep out of the internal link graph unless intentionally reintroduced |

## Highest-Leverage Work Next
1. get Matt's detailed feedback on the current `/programs/` review baseline
2. iterate on the Programs page until the visual system feels right
3. only then apply the approved direction to other non-home pages

## Audit Notes
- The live homepage is ahead of the rest of the site.
- Secondary pages are often present structurally but not yet persuasive enough to be considered finished.
- Architecture cleanup should happen before large new page expansion so the internal link graph stops drifting.
