# Website Decisions Log

## 2026-04-14
- This public website build should stay separate from the internal Ground Control concept and naming.
- The repo should maintain a dedicated website-specific source-of-truth folder for architecture and progress tracking.
- `/marketing-services/` is the canonical service section.
- `/services/` is intentionally not part of the approved website and should be retired from all internal linking.
- `/pricing/` is intentionally not part of the approved website and should not be reintroduced as a canonical page.
- `/contact/` is the canonical contact route.
- `/resources/contact/` is non-canonical and should be removed from internal linking.
- `/resources/guides/` is out of scope and should be retired.
- Approved sitemap includes Home, About, Programs, Marketing Services, Industries, Resources, and Get Started / Book Strategy Call.
- Lawnline (`https://lawnline.marketing/`) is the primary public benchmark to beat on structure, SEO strength, and overall execution quality.

## 2026-04-15
- Approved structural cleanup pass has been applied in the repo.
- `_nav.html`, `_footer.html`, homepage/service CTAs, duplicated page HTML, and `404.html` were updated to remove the retired route drift.
- `resources/contact/index.html` and `resources/guides/index.html` were deleted from the repo.
- Next work should shift from route hygiene to finishing the highest-leverage thin pages.

## 2026-04-15 (continued)
- A second route-hygiene pass removed the remaining broken internal links to orphan routes like `/team/`, `/results/`, `/good-fit/`, `/book/`, and old article URLs.
- Top-priority thin pages were deepened in this workstream: `/programs/`, `/marketing-services/`, `/about/`, and `/contact/`.
- The next highest-leverage page work should move deeper into service detail pages rather than reopening top-level architecture decisions.

## 2026-04-15 (latest)
- Homepage remains the only intentionally developed public page for now.
- All non-home public pages should currently stay header + hero + blank-body placeholder + CTA/footer until the design direction is approved.
- Written body expansion on non-home pages should pause until that design phase begins.

## 2026-04-16
- `/programs/` has been reopened as the current design exploration page.
- A simple body-layout prototype was added to `/programs/` with placeholder/lorem blocks for philosophy, quick breakdown, Growth, Authority, and right-stage guidance.
- A more aggressive visual redesign pass for `/programs/` was attempted and then rejected.
- The simpler pre-v2 Programs version was restored and is the current live state to review from.
- For now, keep the simpler `/programs/` prototype live while Matt reviews and prepares detailed feedback.
- Do not assume the rejected v2 direction should be revived without explicit approval.

## 2026-06-13
- Header and footer are now truly single-source. `_header.html` (announcement bar + nav) and `_footer.html` are the only files to edit; `build.py` stamps them into every page and runs automatically on Vercel deploy via `vercel.json` buildCommand.
- The announcement bar was folded into the universal header and unified across all 31 pages (text + `/contact/` link). Previously the homepage used a relative link and `/404.html` had a stray promo.
- Replaced the old fragile `build-pages.py` (hardcoded `/tmp` path) with `build.py`. Refreshed `_footer.html` to match the current live footer (the partial had gone stale). Brought `/404.html` into the universal header/footer.
- Decision pending from Matt: begin building out the non-home page bodies ("build it out to the best solution") — establish a reusable page design system from the homepage, then roll out across the sitemap.

## 2026-06-14 — Industries locked · homepage deepened · Growth built · `.hl` marker
- **Industries — canonical 8 LOCKED:** lawn-care, lawn-maintenance, landscaping, outdoor-living,
  land-clearing, excavation, septic-services, holiday-lighting. Non-canonical industries (e.g. snow
  removal) were deleted; nav submenu, footer, and `sitemap.xml` reconciled. Icons: Landscaping =
  tree-palm, Lawn Care = sprout (Lucide). Mobile "Industries We Serve" is a compact 2-up grid.
- **Homepage conversion pass:** reordered to hero → stats → industries → services → proof → programs
  → Why L&L → testimonials → logo marquee → FAQ → CTA. Removed the unfinished Blog from nav/flow.
  Added a mini case-study proof row (3 real clients with photos + before→after numbers; no % badges).
  Moved the "Trusted By" logo marquee above testimonials onto the Twilight dot-grid band. Testimonial
  stars → gold-glow. "Why L&L" tightened ("5+ Years" badge → "100% Green Industry Focused"). Applied a
  verified pre-launch audit; softened the ROI claim to a defensible range (kept the dollar figure off
  the page so it never implies pricing). Unified section backgrounds to kill reorder seams. Fixed the
  mobile mega-menu (caret submenus expand instead of navigating).
- **`.hl` Twilight highlight — new reusable brand element:** skewed (−11°) `#6837EF` swipe behind the
  lower portion of one impact phrase, white text, sharp edges. Defined in `styles.css`; **locked into
  the brand kit** (brandkit.lawnlab.dev, §09 Typography). One phrase per surface; never on body or greens.
- **Growth Program page built:** scrapped the old lorem `/programs/` body; built `/programs/growth/`
  lean (Hormozi-style), hand-built (not the generated service template) reusing the same classes.
  Pain cards → four-pillar "What you get" on the Twilight textured band → 2-col Why Us → Twilight CTA.
  **Avatar correction (important):** Growth = $400K–$1M "six-figure" companies that grew OFFLINE and are
  trying to get FOUND for the first time — NOT vendor-sprawl/agency-scar pains (those are Authority).
  A lime-inverted "what you get" was tried and rejected ("too bright") → Twilight purple textured band.
- **Mobile marquee fix:** homepage logo marquee didn't start on iOS until tapped. Cause: 36 lazy, unsized
  logos collapsed the `max-content` track to ~0 width + no GPU layer promotion. Fix: reserve each logo's
  intrinsic size (`width=99 height=38`) + eager-load + promote the track (translateZ / will-change /
  translate3d keyframes). Desktop unchanged.

## 2026-06-15 — Growth SEO pass · footer · docs refresh
- **Growth SEO (from an external audit):** added `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD, `og:url`, Twitter
  card. Aligned the meta description to "six-figure lawn care and landscaping companies" (~155 chars) to
  match the body. Promoted the hero "Growth Program" kicker to the page `<h1>` (keyword in H1), demoting
  the emotional headline to `<h2>` — pixel-identical on screen. Reworked "Why Us" into two columns (image
  placeholder left, copy right, left-aligned). `og:image` deferred to launch.
- **Footer:** "Green industry specialists since **2022**" (corrected from 2020).
- **Schema/canonical convention:** schema uses the production domain (`lawnandlandmarketing.com`); page
  canonicals still point to staging (`new.lawnlab.dev`) and flip at launch.
- **Docs refresh:** brought `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `PAGES_MANIFEST.md`, and the whole
  `docs/website-source-of-truth/` set current; rebuilt `sitemap.xml` to the real routes (the old one
  listed killed routes — `/services/...`, `/pricing/`, `/case-studies/`, fake blog posts).

## 2026-06-15 — Authority Program (flagship) built
- Built `/programs/authority/` as the flagship, cloned from the Growth structure and elevated for the
  **7-figure+** avatar (established, doing real revenue, wants to *dominate* — NOT Growth's get-found
  pains). Sections: hero ("be the most known") → 3 red pain cards (outranked by inferior competitors /
  patchwork vendors / plateaued) → Twilight four-pillar "domination" band (Total Search Domination /
  Everywhere They Look / A Reputation That Closes / Your Whole Marketing Team) → full "everything
  included" deliverables grid (~18 items) → **value play** ("a whole team for less than one hire" — uses
  the ~$60–80K employee-cost anchor, never our fee) → **Roadmap to Domination** timeline (Foundation →
  Climb → Market Dominance → Total Control) → partnership + credibility two-column (50+ clients,
  $300K–$14M+, 97% retention, NALP, Google Partner) → Twilight CTA. Built from the real contract + the
  New Horizon pitch deck. `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` schema, OG/Twitter. **No pricing.** Deliberately
  excluded the deck's "Seven Figure Agency" mention (third-party brand) and specific client P&L numbers;
  used L&L's own agency credentials as proof instead. Both program pages now cross-link.
- **Refined same-day per owner feedback:** dropped "Flagship" from the hero pill; `.hl` Twilight
  highlight applied to "THE company" (problem) and "For less than one hire." (value headline);
  removed the "$60–80K math" reframe line under the value cards and tightened the value→roadmap
  spacing; re-weighted the value cards to **40/60** with the Authority-team box emphasized (bigger
  header, brighter copy, stronger border + purple glow) as the obvious choice; **replaced the
  credibility stat row with the homepage "Proof, Not Promises" section** (real client results —
  Rock Solid, Precision, From The Ground Up). The agency credentials (50+ / $300K–$14M+ / 97% /
  NALP) still live in the Why-L&L partnership paragraph.
- **Universal (same session):** every hero/banner subhead is now **full white `#fff`** (was
  `rgba(255,255,255,0.78)` / `var(--body)` grey) — `.hero-copy p` on all `.simple-hero` pages +
  `.hero-sub` on the homepage. `styles.css?v=135 → 136`.

## 2026-06-15 — Programs hub + submenu icons
- Built the **`/programs/` hub** as a simple two-program window (owner: "a quick window into both
  programs"): hero → "Two Programs / Find the one built for your stage" → two cards (Growth = six-figure,
  Authority = seven-figure; reuses the homepage `.program-card` pattern, Authority featured) each linking
  into its program page → a "not sure which?" book-a-call line. Inspiration: lawnline.marketing/programs/.
- Nav Programs submenu icons: **sprout** for Growth, **trophy** for Authority (Lucide; stamped sitewide).
- Programs submenu refined (desktop + mobile): dropped the "Recommended Path" featured card; the two
  programs now show as side-by-side themed cards — **Growth in lime, Authority in the Twilight textured
  purple** (`.mega-grid--programs` + `.mega-item--growth/--authority` in styles.css; the Authority target
  pill changed green → twilight). About/Marketing-Services dropdowns untouched.

## 2026-06-15 — Programs section LOCKED (sans images)
- Both program pages (**Growth**, **Authority**), the **`/programs/` hub**, and the **nav submenu**
  are locked pending real images — treat the build/wireframe/content as final unless the owner reopens it.
- Ran a sitewide consistency pass on every program mention (homepage "Two Paths" section, hub cards,
  nav mega, footer, homepage FAQ + schema, service-page footer link lists). All consistent: naming
  ("Growth Program" / "Authority Program"), order (Growth → Authority), tier framing (Growth =
  6-figure / under $1M / foundation-and-get-found; Authority = 7-figure / over $1M / dominate), and
  no-pricing.
- **Label convention (locked):** compact pill/badge labels use the **digit** form ("For 6-Figure
  Companies"); running prose uses the **spelled** form ("six-figure"). Standardized the hub badge (the
  lone "Six-Figure" outlier) to digit so it matches the homepage badges + nav pills — also avoids the
  spelled form wrapping in the narrow nav pills.
- **Only remaining program to-do:** drop real images into the hero/Why-Us placeholders on the program pages.

## 2026-06-15 — Nav submenu overhaul (tightened all four dropdowns)
- **About:** removed the founder/right-rail card; the dropdown is now a compact single-column
  `.mega-panel--narrow` (380px) — About / Meet The Team / **Experiences & Testimonials**. The
  Experiences item is themed in the Twilight textured purple (`.mega-item--twilight`) with a
  glowing gold star icon, and links to `/resources/experiences-reviews/`.
- **Marketing Services & Industries:** the styled promo headline ("Most Companies Don't Need
  Another Vendor." / "We Only Work In The Green Industry.") is no longer an `<h4>` — moved to a
  `<div class="mega-fc-title">` that inherits the exact former `h4` look (Rethink Sans italic 800).
  This was an **SEO fix** — nav promo copy was polluting the page heading hierarchy. The Marketing
  Services body copy was rewritten to the "one connected system… run by a single team that owns the
  result" framing.
- **Resources — full rebuild:** the featured card is now a Twilight-textured, clickable testimonials
  card (glowing gold 5-star row, "Client Experiences" label, links to `/resources/experiences-reviews/`
  — same target as the About item, anticipating a page full of testimonial videos/screenshots). The
  six items are reorganized into two columns: **Mow Money, Mow Problems** (the Podcast → on-site page
  that will show off the show + let people apply as a guest · YouTube channel ↗ · the Book → Amazon ↗)
  and **Learn & Connect** (Green Industry Insights/Blog · Private Facebook Group ↗ "Service Area
  Experts" · Contact Us). External links open in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`).
- **Decision (flag for Matt):** the "Mow Money, Mow Problems" **Book** links straight to the **Amazon**
  product page (new tab) rather than a dedicated on-site page — simplest path, and Amazon already
  converts. Trivial to swap to a dedicated page later if we want on-site reviews/long-form.
- New nav CSS added to `styles.css`: `.mega-panel--narrow`, `.mega-grid--single`, `.mega-item--twilight`,
  `.mega-featured-card--twilight`, `.mega-fc-stars`, and `.mega-fc-title` (extends the former
  `.mega-featured-card h4` rule so the de-headinged titles keep the identical look). `styles.css?v=137 → 138`.
  Header re-stamped sitewide via `build.py`. Programs / hub / program pages untouched.

## 2026-06-15 — Industry-page framework locked + Landscaping built (1 of 8)
- **Reusable industry-page framework** (built on Landscaping; applies to all 8). Section order:
  hero + above-fold trust strip → answer-first definition + "Updated {Month YYYY}" → "why generic
  marketing fails" + **specialist-vs-generalist comparison table** → **seasonality module** ("we
  market your company one season ahead" — four season cards on the Twilight band; the centerpiece and
  biggest information-gain play) → "what we build" service grid (each card links to its
  `/marketing-services/*` page) → numbered 5-step process → **Proof, Not Promises** (the real homepage
  case row, reused) → "why us" + real credential strip → program-fit cards (Growth / Authority) →
  **visible FAQ accordion (answer-first) + FAQPage schema** → Twilight `svc-cta`.
- **Built for SEO + GEO + EEAT** (from fresh 2026 research + a Lawnline industry-page teardown): one
  keyword-bearing H1, question/claim H2s, answer-first ~40–75-word section openers, a comparison table
  + numbered list (high AI-citation formats), "information gain" only a specialist could write (the
  seasonality math + the three-businesses model: design qualifies → installs earn → maintenance sustains),
  a `@graph` JSON-LD block (Organization + Service + WebPage + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage), a visible
  freshness date, and internal links to every service page + both programs + a sibling industry.
  **Lawnline's industry pages carry NO FAQ and almost no seasonality depth — that gap is our edge.**
- **No invented facts:** proof = the three real homepage clients (all landscaping — Rock Solid,
  Precision, From The Ground Up); credentials = the real homepage/footer signals (NALP, Google Partner,
  100+ companies, 97%+ retention, since 2022). No pricing; the "cost" FAQ answers intent and routes to
  the free call.
- **CSS:** the framework lives in the Landscaping page's scoped `<style>` as reusable `.ind-*` classes
  (`.ind-sec`, `.ind-band`, `.ind-compare`, `.ind-seasons`, `.ind-svc`, `.ind-steps`, `.ind-cred`,
  `.ind-fit`, `.ind-faq`). For pages 2–8, copy that block per page; extract to a shared `industry.css`
  only if we later want to dedupe. **No global CSS change → no cache-bump** (still `styles.css?v=138`,
  `service-page.css?v=3`). Hand-built pages link both stylesheets and wrap content in `<main id="main">`.
- **Next:** roll the framework to the remaining 7 industry pages (lawn-care, lawn-maintenance,
  outdoor-living, land-clearing, excavation, septic-services, holiday-lighting) — each with its own
  seasonality, service emphasis, comparison rows, proof framing, and FAQ. Owner wants them crushed one
  at a time, not batch-generated.

## 2026-06-16 — Industry-page freshness: honest schema date only
- Removed the visible "Updated {Month}" chip (`.ind-updated`) from industry pages. The freshness signal
  now lives **only** in the page schema's `dateModified`, bumped **only on a real update**.
- **Rejected** auto-stamping the current month via script: that's "fake freshness" Google distrusts (it
  cross-checks the date against actual content change → can be discounted or hurt trust) and it violates
  our **no-invented-facts** rule — a bad look for a marketing agency. Earn freshness by genuinely
  refreshing the page (natural hook: a seasonal content refresh), and bump the schema date then.
- Applied to `/industries/landscaping/` and baked into `industry-page-template.md` (Non-negotiables → Freshness).

## 2026-06-16 — Landscaping page feedback (round 1)
- **Intro section** redesigned as a two-column block (`.ind-split`): image placeholder left; eyebrow +
  H2 ("You're not hard to hire. You're hard to find.") + the answer-first definition right-aligned on the
  right. Replaces the centered single-column intro (and fills the gap left by removing the "updated" chip).
- **Google Partner badge** now uses the real **multicolor Google "G" logo** everywhere on the page (hero
  trust strip + credential strip) — made a non-negotiable in `industry-page-template.md`.
- Trimmed the hero trust strip to 3 badges (removed "97%+ client retention"; it still lives in the
  credential strip below).

## 2026-06-16 — Sitewide service icons + "CRM & Automation" rename + landscaping tweaks
- **Canonical service icons (Lucide), consistent everywhere** — the submenu, service-page CTAs, homepage,
  hub, and industry grids now share one icon per service. New icons per owner: Website Design →
  `monitor-smartphone`, Google Ads → `badge-check`, Meta Ads → `book-user`, CRM & Automation →
  `refresh-ccw`; the rest standardized (Local SEO `search`, GBP `map-pin`, AI Partner `bot`, Reputation
  `star`). Machine source of truth: **`SERVICE_MAP` in `gen_service.py`**; registry in `navigation.md`.
  New Lucide paths pulled verbatim from source.
- **"Automation" → "CRM & Automation"** everywhere (display name only; slug stays
  `/marketing-services/automation/`). Updated `_content.json` (regenerated the page — now leans into CRM
  capture/track + automation follow-up), the submenu, footer, homepage tab, and hub.
- **Landscaping page:** seasonality headline + all "one season ahead" copy → **"ahead of the seasons"**
  (not limiting to a single season; still seasonal). Added an **8th service card — Your AI Partner — as
  the Twilight standout** (`.ind-svc--ai`, bot icon) emphasizing AI search ranking, AI implementation,
  and staying ahead of trends. (The intro two-column / Google-G / trust-strip tweaks from the prior round
  are also live.)

## 2026-06-16 — Landscaping: testimonials added + Why-Us restructured
- **Added a testimonials section** (`.testi-section`) right after "Proof, Not Promises" — three REAL video
  testimonials (Logan's Landscaping, Brothers Outdoor Services, VASH Landscaping; faces + quotes + gold
  stars), reused from the homepage, with a "See more client experiences" link to
  `/resources/experiences-reviews/`. Rationale: the proof row shows numbers; testimonials add the
  voices/faces. Real, attributed — never invented. (Now part of the framework: proof = numbers + voices.)
- **"Why Lawn & Land" restructured** to a two-column block (`.ind-split--flip`): copy left (left-aligned),
  image placeholder right. Removed the credential box (NALP / Google Partner / 100+ / 97% / since 2022) —
  those signals still live in the hero trust strip and the footer.

## 2026-06-16 — Template review pass (SEO tightening + reuse rules)
- Reviewed the landscaping page as the locked template (independent audit + own pass). Verdict: strong
  (~1,700 words, clean structure, full schema, real information-gain). Tightened + future-proofed:
- **On the page:** H1 now leads with the literal keyword ("Landscaping marketing for companies…");
  de-clichéd the testimonials H2 ("Don't Take Our Word For It" → "What landscaping owners say about
  working with us"); added an HTML TEMPLATE/REUSE comment on the proof+testimonials block.
- **Template rules added to `industry-page-template.md`:**
  - **The demand-cycle module is two layouts**, not a locked 4-season grid: (A) 4-season calendar for the
    seasonal trades; (B) demand-mode cards for the less-seasonal trades (septic =
    emergency/routine/real-estate/compliance; excavation + land-clearing = frost/dig-season + permit
    windows). Forcing four seasons on septic would be fluff that undercuts the "we know your business" promise.
  - **Proof/testimonial reuse rule:** every real testimonial/case number is a lawn/landscape client — keep
    the content on every page, but genericize the FRAMING to "green industry" + a bridge line ("the same
    system and team we'd put behind your [trade] business") on septic/land-clearing/excavation/holiday-lighting.
    Honest; never invent same-trade testimonials.
  - H1 must contain the literal "[industry] marketing" phrase; clever hooks stay as kickers, not the H1/money H2s.
- **Launch checklist:** flagged localizing the hero NALP badge (loads from the legacy WordPress domain) into `/assets/`.
- **Open for Matt:** (1) the "Why Lawn & Land" two-col slightly overlaps the hero strip + comparison table +
  FAQ on the "we only do green industry" message — option to evolve its copy to add team/years instead of
  restating focus; (2) confirm the demand-mode seasonality approach for septic / excavation / land-clearing.

## 2026-06-16 — Removed the standalone "Why Lawn & Land" section
- Eliminated the two-column "Why Lawn & Land" section from the landscaping page (and the framework). Its
  whole message ("we only work in the green industry") was already made — better — by the hero trust badge,
  the FAQ ("Do you only work with landscaping companies?"), and especially the **comparison table, which IS
  the "why us"** (specialist vs. generalist, with information gain). Cutting it removes a redundant beat with
  zero loss of argument and tightens the flow to proof → testimonials → program-fit → FAQ → CTA. The page is
  now 10 sections. Updated `industry-page-template.md`.

## 2026-06-16 — Third-party SEO audit: adopted the one held point (answer-first opener)
- The external auditor conceded our pushbacks (homeowner vocabulary was overcalled; the brand H2s and the
  "design-build" title scope stand; **no Review/AggregateRating on first-party testimonials** — self-serving,
  no rich result + manual-action risk). Its one fair remaining point: more **answer-first openers** for GEO.
- **Adopted:** rewrote the Process section opener to name the five steps up front (an extractable answer to
  "How we grow a landscaping company") while keeping the "no 50-item checklist, no guesswork" voice. The
  other section openers are already extractable, so no further changes.
- **Note for when About / Meet-the-Team are built:** industry pages should link to a **named human/agency
  authority** (Google "Authoritativeness"), not a generic shell — that's where deep EEAT lives, off the money page.

## 2026-06-16 — Built Lawn Care (page 2); extracted shared `industry.css`; acted on a 2nd template audit
- **Lawn Care page built** (`/industries/lawn-care/`) off the locked template — reframed for the recurring
  treatment-program business (route density + retention, not high-ticket installs): 4-season demand cycle
  (winter prepay/renewals → spring rush → summer fulfill + book fall → fall aerate/overseed/re-sign),
  lawn-care comparison rows + FAQ (retention + route-density Qs), proof/testimonials framed "lawn and landscape."
- **CSS extracted to a shared file** — RESOLVES the open sub-question below. The `.ind-*` framework was
  duplicated verbatim across landscaping + lawn-care; pulled it into **`/assets/css/industry.css`** (`?v=1`)
  and replaced each page's inline block with a one-line pointer comment + a `<link>`. Did this now (after
  page 2, before page 3) so the duplication never reaches three pages. No global CSS changed.
- **Second third-party audit of the template** (shared FYI, "change only if it changes things for you"):
  graded the structure A−, flagged process gaps, not content. Acted on the substantive ones in
  `industry-page-template.md`: (1) demand-mode trades CANNOT be written from the seed — research is mandatory;
  (2) lawn-care vs. lawn-maintenance keyword split must be decided BEFORE building lawn-maintenance (anti-
  cannibalization); (3) added an **answer-first verification step** to the build checklist (read only first
  sentences top-to-bottom); (4) the CSS extraction above; (5) a recommended build order (seasonal layout-A
  pages first, demand-mode layout-B last); plus a Lawnline re-verify caveat and a stronger septic bridge
  (bridge on the transferable local-demand mechanism, not client similarity).

## 2026-06-17 — Resolved the lawn-care/lawn-maintenance axis; re-pointed Lawn Care to recurring revenue
- A second review of the live Lawn Care page (third-party agent) confirmed the keyword-collision risk both
  template audits flagged: the page led on **"fill the route" / route density**, which is really the
  *maintenance* (mowing) page's mental model. Two pages leading on "the route" would cannibalize each other.
- **Owner decision:** Lawn Care's spine = **recurring revenue / program** (renewals, retention, LTV);
  Lawn Maintenance's spine = **route / mowing operations**. Locked in `industry-page-template.md`.
- **Re-pointed the Lawn Care page accordingly:** H1 "…fill the route" → "…**grow recurring revenue**"; hero,
  intro definition, why-generic + seasons ledes, services H2, program-fit, Growth card, and CTA all moved to
  the recurring-program story. Route density kept as a *supporting* beat (one comparison row, the Meta Ads
  geo-targeting tactic, its dedicated FAQ). Also tightened the two hook-first openers to **answer-first** (the
  new build-checklist step in action) and bumped `dateModified` to 2026-06-17 (honest — real content edit).
- The review's other points: schema verified clean from source (entities swapped, honest date — no action);
  "homeowner" vocabulary left as-is (owner-focused ratio is fine, same call as landscaping); the universal
  **footer tagline** was narrowing to "landscaping companies" on every page — broadened to "your business."
- **Reminder for the lawn-maintenance build:** route/density is ITS headline; do not reuse Lawn Care's spine.

## 2026-06-17 — Built Lawn Maintenance + Outdoor Living (industry pages 3 & 4)
- Built both off the locked template after a real research pass per page (parallel research agents +
  Lawnline re-verify, per the playbook). Both verified on preview (valid `@graph`, one H1, no console errors)
  and pushed; staging deploys automatically.
- **Lawn Maintenance** (`/industries/lawn-maintenance/`) — the property's upkeep business (mowing, cleanups,
  bed maintenance). **Route density is the headline** — the "windshield time" margin spine lawn-care ceded,
  so the two pages don't compete. 4-season cycle: winter lock routes/prepay → spring sign-up rush → summer
  tighten + pre-sell fall → fall cleanups/leaf + snow upsell + re-sign. FAQ explicitly disambiguates
  lawn-care vs lawn-maintenance and links the sibling, so Google reads them as distinct.
- **Outdoor Living** (`/industries/outdoor-living/`) — high-ticket design-build/hardscape. Spine = the
  **portfolio (the product) + the long, financed sale**. Demand cycle is **inverted** vs. the recurring
  trades: winter is prime SELL/design season (fill the spring build calendar); summer is for building +
  harvesting reviews; fall re-opens selling + pitches financing. Keyword-differentiated from Landscaping
  (hardscape/structures/financing here; softscape/green/install + maintenance there).
- **Lawnline re-verify findings:** they now have BOTH a lawn-maintenance page (already mentions route
  density/retention) and a hardscape/outdoor-living page — but **neither has an FAQ or a real demand cycle**,
  and the hardscape page never mentions financing. So our edge on both is depth: visible FAQ + quarter-by-
  quarter demand cycle (+ financing on outdoor living). Benchmark snapshot updated.
- **Remaining: 4** — holiday-lighting (last seasonal/layout-A), then the demand-mode trio
  septic-services / land-clearing / excavation (layout-B, each needs a fuller research pass).

## 2026-06-17 — Built the final 4 industry pages; all 8 complete; demand-mode pattern proven
- Built **Holiday Lighting, Land Clearing, Excavation, Septic Services** off the locked template (researched
  per page; Lawnline re-verified). All 8 canonical industry pages are now developed. Each verified on preview
  (valid `@graph`, one H1, no console errors), pushed; staging deploys automatically.
- **The big one for this batch: NO four-season calendar on these trades.** Three are project/demand-driven,
  one is hyper-seasonal-but-compressed. So the demand-cycle module flexes (the `.ind-seasons` grid takes any
  4 cards): **holiday-lighting** = phase cycle (pre-sell → booking → install → takedown/re-book; "ahead of
  the season" still fits); **land-clearing** = pipeline / ground-access / burn windows / fire-mitigation;
  **excavation** = pipeline / residential-vs-commercial two-buyer split / dig conditions / 811+permits;
  **septic** = emergency / routine / real-estate / compliance. Each `.hl` headline reflects the REAL cycle
  ("how septic demand actually shows up", "how clearing work actually comes in", etc.), not "ahead of the seasons".
- **Cannibalization discipline held:** clearing↔excavation carry mirrored disambiguation FAQs (clearing =
  remove what's on the land; excavation = shape the earth; clearing first) and cross-link; excavation↔septic
  cross-link so septic install/compliance stays on the septic page.
- **Off-trade proof reuse:** all four use real lawn/landscape proof genericized to "green industry" + a
  per-trade bridge. Septic is the hardest stretch, so it bridges on the **transferable local-demand mechanism**
  (found-first + reviews + follow-up), not client similarity, per the §7 septic note.
- **NEW BRAND RULE applied: no em dashes in customer-facing copy.** Came in via the owner's build prompt; all
  four new pages were authored em-dash-free (commas/periods/restructure). The earlier four pages (landscaping,
  lawn-care, lawn-maintenance, outdoor-living) and the shared nav/footer still contain em dashes. **Open
  question for the owner:** do a careful sitewide em-dash pass for consistency, or leave the earlier pages as
  is? (A blind find/replace is unsafe; em dashes sometimes need a period vs comma vs restructure.)
- Added the no-em-dash rule to `industry-page-template.md` non-negotiables; updated the build-order note (all
  8 done), `page-registry.md`, `build-status.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-06-17 — Repositioned the septic page from "services" to "installers" (owner's real prospect)
- **Decision (owner):** the real prospect in this vertical is the **septic installer**, not the pump-and-service
  company. Pure installers (install + drainfield replacement, no pumping/emergency), even mix of replacement +
  new construction. So the page was **repositioned**, not tweaked.
- **Key insight:** a septic *installer* is a high-ticket, project-based, permit-gated business — structurally
  much closer to **Excavation** than to a pumping company. It's won on licensing, permit-fluency, system-design
  capability, and proof, not on emergency speed-to-answer.
- **What changed:** the whole spine. H1 "get found first when an emergency hits" → **"win more install and
  drainfield jobs."** Demand modes flipped from service (emergency / routine / realtor / compliance) to install
  (**failed-system replacement / new construction / real-estate upgrade / compliance & permits**). `.hl` headline
  "how septic demand actually shows up" → **"how install work actually comes in."** Comparison rows, services,
  FAQ, and the proof bridge all re-pointed to the high-ticket, two-buyer (failed-system homeowner + builder/GC)
  install business. Softened the LSA claim (LSA leans service/repair; install eligibility is a launch-verify item).
- **Slug renamed** `/industries/septic-services/` → **`/industries/septic-installation/`** (pre-launch, so clean;
  no redirect needed). Nav label "Septic Services" → **"Septic Installation"**, mega-menu microcopy updated, and
  every reference re-pointed: `_header.html`, `_footer.html`, homepage industry card, `sitemap.xml`, the
  excavation cross-link, and all docs. `build.py` restamped; verified zero orphan `septic-services` links.
- **The other 7 pages and the canonical-8 list are unchanged** — this is a refinement of one industry, not a
  re-scope. Excavation↔septic cross-links still hold (excavation defers septic installs to this page).
- **Audit follow-up (same day):** a third-party review flagged the predicted risk — repositioning to "installer"
  made septic structurally close to **Excavation** (shared two-buyer split, near-identical "Runs two engines" +
  high-ticket comparison rows, a duplicate process step). Core keywords don't collide, but the *section content*
  did, dampening both pages' topical distinctiveness. **Fix:** re-pointed septic's spine to **the licensed
  septic-system specialty** (license, permits/perc tests, conventional/mound/ATU/engineered systems, passing
  inspection — the moat an excavator cannot claim); rewrote the comparison table so it shares **zero** row labels
  with Excavation; de-duped process step 4; demoted the two-buyer split to a supporting beat (kept in the demand
  cards, removed as a comparison row). Verified zero shared comparison-row labels between the two pages.
- **Full-site septic sweep (per owner):** swept the whole site for septic references and aligned them to the
  installer framing — the Industries-hub list + meta/OG ("septic" → "septic installation"), the four reuse-rule
  HTML comments (old slug → new), the mega-menu microcopy. Confirmed point-of-sale septic is claimed only here.
- **Explicit decision: installer-only.** We have **consciously vacated the septic-pumping/service keyword space**
  (real volume, but not the owner's prospect). A separate service page remains a future option and would NOT
  cannibalize the installer page (different spine) — ironic, since the old pump-service page was *further* from
  Excavation than the installer page is. 301 redirect from the old slug added to the launch checklist.

## 2026-06-17 — Completed the sitewide em-dash pass (RESOLVES the open question above)
- **Decision (owner): yes, full sitewide pass.** Done. Removed every em dash from customer-facing copy across
  the whole site, **672 → 0**. The rationale that won it: for a *marketing agency's own* site, em-dash overuse
  is the single most recognizable "AI-written" tell, so it's a real credibility issue; and the half-done state
  (4 clean pages, rest not) was the worst version.
- **Done by hand, judged per instance** (not a blind find/replace, which would create comma splices and run-ons):
  parentheticals with internal commas → parentheses; list lead-ins → colons; tag-ons / causal "so" / expansions →
  commas; strong contrasts and punchlines → periods. **En dashes in ranges preserved** (Sept–Nov, 3–5 yrs, $60K–$80K).
- **Fixed at the SOURCE so it stays clean going forward:** `_header.html` + `_footer.html` (8 em dashes stamped
  into all 32 pages — the biggest single win, ~38% of the total), `_content.json` (regenerated the 7 service
  pages), the `gen_service.py` template (the "what's included" subhead + the FAQ placeholder), and
  `PAGE_TEMPLATE.html`. So future regenerated/stamped pages are born em-dash-free.
- **Verified:** 0 em dashes across all HTML and all build sources; `build.py --check` passes; `_content.json`
  valid; homepage + a regenerated service page render with no console errors. (Docs/`.md`/code-comments are not
  customer-facing and were left as-is, except where edited.)

## 2026-06-17 — Killed heading "widows" (a lone word on a heading's last line) sitewide
- **Problem (owner-reported):** the two-line intro hooks on the industry pages (e.g. "Filling the
  pipeline is the hard / part.") were stranding a single word on the last line — "a bad look." Seen on
  desktop *and* sometimes mobile.
- **Root cause:** `text-wrap: balance` (already global on headings) evens line *widths*, not word
  *counts*. With a hard `<br>` or a long compound word it can legitimately leave one word alone. So
  `balance` can never *guarantee* against it — wrong tool for the guarantee. Confirmed by measuring real
  render boxes in the browser, not eyeballing.
- **Fix — two layers:**
  1. **Widow-guard in `main.js`** (`?v=54`): on load, for every heading (`h1–h4`) outside nav/footer,
     it glues the last two words of each `<br>`-delimited segment with a non-breaking space, so the last
     line always carries 2+ words **at any viewport width and on future copy**. Skips the animated hero
     H1 and any heading already hand-glued. Inserts only ` ` (never reorders/removes), so it cannot
     break layout — worst case it does nothing. Handles words inside `.hl` / gradient spans correctly.
  2. **Hard-glued the 8 industry intro-hook H2s in the HTML** too (belt-and-suspenders — those stay
     fixed even with JS disabled, since they're the most visible headings).
- **Verified** by measuring rendered line boxes (Range API) across 5 structurally-distinct page types
  (industry, homepage, Growth, Authority, service template) at **1280 and 375** — **zero** single-word
  last lines anywhere, including the multi-segment `<br>` headers and span-wrapped phrases.
- **Why JS, not pure CSS or hand-gluing every heading:** CSS can't guarantee it; hand-gluing every
  heading is unmaintainable and breaks on new copy. The guard is automatic, future-proof, and degrades
  gracefully.

## 2026-06-17 — Comparison table goes to stacked cards on phones (no sideways scroll)
- **Problem (owner-reported):** the "green-industry specialist vs. generalist agency" table
  (`.ind-compare`, shared on all 8 industry pages) looked great on desktop but on mobile it was a
  horizontally-scrolling table — the row labels (left) and the whole "generalist" column (right) sat
  off-screen, and nothing signals there's more to swipe to. With most traffic on mobile, half the
  section was effectively invisible.
- **Fix (CSS only, `industry.css?v=2`, `@media max-width:680px`):** the `<table>` reflows into
  **stacked cards**, one per comparison row. Each card = the criterion as an italic heading, then the
  **Lawn & Land** answer (green eyebrow + green left-accent + faint green tint = the "winner") and the
  **A generalist agency** answer (muted) below it. Column headers (`<thead>`) hide on mobile; each
  cell gets its own label via CSS `::before` so the side is always clear. No markup change — pure CSS,
  so it covers all 8 pages at once and is keyed only on the existing `.row-label` / `.col-us` /
  `.col-them` classes.
- **Desktop is byte-for-byte unchanged** (everything is inside the mobile media query; verified the
  table still renders as `display:table` with visible `<thead>`, 560px min-width, no pseudo-labels).
- **Verified** on the preview at 390px (land-clearing + septic-installation): zero page-level
  horizontal scroll, cards render with correct labels and the green keyword highlights intact; and at
  1280px the original table is untouched.

## 2026-06-17 — Built the About page (real content, owner-led, SEO/E-E-A-T)
- **Built from the owner's REAL content, no invented facts.** Pulled the live legacy pages
  (`/about/`, `/is-marketing-right-for-us/`, `/reviews/`) via raw-HTML extraction (WebFetch truncated
  on the heavy Avada markup; curl + a tag-stripper got the real copy). Preserved the real mission
  ("your personal team", "not just another statistic") and the real owner bio (Matt Foreman; prior
  agency Shoot To Thrill Media, 2016; deliberate pivot to the green industry) nearly verbatim,
  emoji-free per brand.
- **Structure** (existing components, modeled on the Growth page): hero (team-hero bg, keyword H1/H2)
  → mission → Meet the Owner (real family photo `assets/images/matt-foreman.jpg`, 1200x1800, portrait)
  → why-specialization (Twilight band, 3 cards) → values/transparency (3 cards, incl. the "we publish
  our worst review" ethos borrowed from Reviews) → condensed good-fit / not-a-fit framework → stat band
  → Twilight CTA.
- **Schema:** `@graph` = Organization + Person (Matt, founder) + AboutPage + BreadcrumbList (production
  domain, staging canonical). Strong E-E-A-T.
- **Bonus-page verdict (owner asked):** the good-fit/not-a-fit framework → folded into About (high trust
  + SEO). The Reviews testimonials + "Lyle / worst review" story → stay a dedicated Reviews page; About
  only borrows the transparency ethos.
- **Team decision (owner delegated):** consolidate, don't split. One strong owner-led About page beats a
  thin standalone "Meet the Team" page for SEO/E-E-A-T; the owner section is structured to add real team
  members later. **PENDING OWNER OK:** retire `/resources/meet-the-team/` from nav submenu + footer
  (fold into About) + launch redirect. Not changed yet.
- **Stats reused (VERIFY before launch):** 100+ companies, 97% retention (owner chose 97% over the
  legacy 95-96%), since 2022, NALP membership. All already published elsewhere on the new site.
- **Verified** on preview at 1280 + 390: clean H1->H2->H3 outline, no horizontal scroll, fit + owner
  sections stack on mobile, family photo well-framed, 0 em dashes, 0 emoji, widow-guard handles the
  hero `<br>`, `build.py --check` in sync.

## 2026-06-17 — Meet the Team consolidated into About; About polish
- **Team consolidation EXECUTED** (owner delegated the call, then supplied the source). Extracted the
  real team from the legacy `/our-team/` page (raw-HTML parse: each photo's `<img>` immediately precedes
  that person's name heading, so the mapping is structural, not guessed). 10 members (Matt Foreman is
  the separate Meet-the-Owner section, so excluded from the grid): Leadership (Sandi Jaramillo, Juan
  Calderon, Honey Zamora, Damien Friedenthal) + Green Marketing Specialists (Anne Venus, Daisy Llorico,
  Jez Pangan, Matt Jones, Nadia Louw, Patricia Caretiro). Headshots downloaded + optimized to
  `assets/images/team/<slug>.jpg` (520x520, ~50-75KB each).
- Added a **Meet the Team** grid to About (`#team`, square cards, Leadership 4-col / Specialists 3-col,
  2-col on mobile). Standalone `/resources/meet-the-team/` shell **deleted**, removed from `sitemap.xml`,
  and nav + footer links updated. **Final state (owner decision, same day): the "Meet The Team" nav
  submenu item and footer link were SUNSET entirely** — not repointed. The team lives on only as the
  About `#team` section (reachable via the About nav item); there is no standalone team label anywhere
  in the chrome. Verified 0 `/about/#team` links and 0 "Meet the Team" nav/footer text sitewide. Launch
  301 `/resources/meet-the-team/` → `/about/#team` noted on the checklist.
- **Retention stat → `97%+`** (owner confirmed: actually upper-97 to low-98, comfortable saying over 97).
- **Owner family photo mobile reframe:** was `aspect 4/3 @ object-position 26%` (too much sky above his
  head); now `4/5 @ 42%` so the family fills the frame. Desktop unchanged (`4/5 @ 30%`, owner liked it).
- **CSS gotcha fixed:** `.team-card img` needed `height:auto` — the `height="520"` HTML attribute was
  overriding `aspect-ratio:1/1` and rendering tall cards. (The owner photo already had `height:auto`.)

## 2026-06-17 — About page: external SEO audit response (EEAT anchor)
- Auditor graded the page on EEAT + conversion (correct lens for an About page) and compared it to
  Lawnline. Net: we win on trust/team-depth/human-founder; close gaps were technical + scope.
- **Schema was already present** (auditor couldn't see it on a rendered fetch and assumed it might be
  missing). Confirmed Organization + Person + AboutPage + BreadcrumbList. **Added** `memberOf` (NALP) and
  `employee` (the 10 team members as Person entities) to the Organization node.
- **Scope language widened** — it said "built exclusively for lawn care and landscaping companies" in
  meta/OG/schema/hero, too narrow for an 8-trade site. Now leads with "green-industry marketing agency"
  and names the breadth (lawn & landscape -> land clearing, excavation, septic). Earns the head term
  "green-industry marketing agency" once, visibly (hero).
- **Third-party reviews:** added an outbound "Read our reviews on Google" link (owner-supplied
  share.google link) in the stat band — stronger EEAT than on-page testimonials.
- **Roster / the Jez photo bug:** owner confirmed all names + titles accurate. BUT the legacy
  `/our-team/` page has a FIRED employee's old photo (Ali Mustafa, "Facebook Ads Specialist") sitting in
  **Jez Pangan's** card — proven by the image's `alt` text. My position-based scrape inherited it.
  Replaced with a clean **"JP" initials placeholder** (`.team-ph`); **need Jez's real headshot from the
  owner.** (The owner's live WP site still shows Ali's face under Jez's name — flagged to fix there too.)
- **Declined (owner):** a scale dollar figure (they don't have Lawnline-size numbers and won't fabricate)
  and a hard tenure reframe (the bio already honestly carries "Shoot To Thrill, 2016" + "green industry
  since 2022"; being the smaller, more-honest option is the brand edge, so no "10+ years" inflation).
- **Parked (post-launch):** per-person team bios / deeper team entities; A/B-watch the "we lean on AI"
  line for the more traditional buyer.

## 2026-06-19 — Built the Experiences & Reviews page (social-proof EEAT anchor)
- **Purpose:** the trust/social-proof hub, built to rank + feed AI/crawlers + convert. Owner wants it to
  grow into a big "wall" of testimonial videos + review screenshots ("wow, look at all these").
- **Populated now with REAL existing content** (pulled from the homepage, no inventing): 6 video
  testimonials (Peter Logan/Logan's, Phillip Sirmon/P&C, Zach Franz/Rock Solid, Rick McCarty/Brothers,
  Prentiss Holt/VASH, Nate Moses/Precision) + 3 case studies (Rock Solid $700K→$1.3M, Precision 200→600
  calls/mo, From The Ground Up $1.8M→$3.2M) + the "they stay" retention line + the worst-review
  transparency play.
- **Built to grow:** reuses the homepage `.testi-card` / `.testi-video-wrap` components (so the
  click-to-play already works via existing `main.js`) and the `.proof-cases-grid`. The video grid
  auto-flows, with an HTML comment template for adding a card. Screenshot wall + more videos get added
  as the owner sends the Google Drive content.
- **Reviews-microsite cross-link strategy (owner):** owner bought `lawnandlandmarketingreviews.com` (an
  exact-match "[company] reviews" domain) to rank for "[company] reviews" queries. This page links OUT
  to it (dofollow, `See all our reviews`) + to the Google Business reviews; the microsite should link
  BACK to the main site (owner's side). Cross-link confirmed live (microsite returns 200).
- **Schema:** `CollectionPage` + `BreadcrumbList`. **Deliberately NO `Review` / `AggregateRating`** on
  first-party testimonials (established rule; Google won't show self-serving stars and it risks a
  penalty). VideoObject held until real per-video metadata (upload dates) exists.
- Verified on preview: click-to-play spawns the right YouTube iframe, 6/6 thumbnails load, mobile +
  desktop clean, no orphans/scroll, em-dash + emoji free, `build.py --check` in sync.

## 2026-06-19 — Experiences page revisions (owner feedback)
- **Removed the "worst review" transparency section** — owner reversed course, does not want that route.
  (Was a strong EEAT signal per the auditor, but owner's call; gone from the page.)
- **Removed the TOP Google-reviews link** (intro). Owner: videos are the highest-value proof, Google is
  the lowest, and he doesn't want to funnel people to Google from the top. **One** Google link remains,
  in the bottom cross-link band (owner approved keeping that one).
- **Added a 5-star signal** at the top of the "Our clients say it best" section (gold stars + "Five-star
  rated by green-industry owners across the country" — qualitative, no fabricated numeric average).
- **Added an 11-screenshot wall** (masonry `.shot-wall`, real screenshots pulled from the legacy
  `/reviews/`: Google reviews, client texts, social posts) in `assets/images/reviews/`. Scales as more
  are added (HTML comment template included).
- **VIDEO HOSTING — open decision (owner):** owner's Drive folder has 16 raw .mp4 testimonials (24-84MB
  each, growing). Raw video can't live in the static repo, and Drive embeds get throttled on a public
  page. Recommended **YouTube** (matches the existing 6, free, scales, no quota, best for SEO). Awaiting
  owner's choice before wiring more videos in.

## 2026-06-19 — Built the vertical video testimonial wall (22 Shorts)
- **Video hosting RESOLVED:** owner chose YouTube. Team uploaded 22 short-form (9:16) testimonial
  **Shorts** across 8 clients (Zach/Rock Solid, Tami/Artistic Landscape Features, Rick/Brothers Outdoor,
  Phillip/P&C, Peter/Logan's, Nate/Precision, David/Creative Edge, Tim/Hill) as Public, and dropped the
  embed links in a Google Sheet. Built a dense **vertical wall** (`.vt-grid` / `.vtcard`, 5-up desktop /
  2-up mobile), **interleaving clients** so the top rows show variety. Reused the existing
  `.testi-video-wrap` click-to-play JS (just overrode the aspect to 9/16 via `.short-vid`).
- **Replaced the 6 older landscape testimonial cards** on this page (went all-vertical for consistency +
  density; the landscape 6 still live on the homepage). Can re-add them as a "featured" row if the owner
  wants.
- **Thumbnails:** YouTube serves a clean 9:16 vertical poster at `i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/oardefault.jpg`
  (confirmed for all 22). Hotlinked, no hosting needed.
- **VideoObject schema** for all 22 (name = the YouTube title, description = per-clip summary,
  thumbnailUrl, embedUrl, contentUrl, uploadDate=2026-06-19 approx). This is the video-rich-result /
  AI-crawl signal.
- **Flag for owner:** Tami's YouTube *descriptions* say "Building Growth Landscaping" but her business
  (and the video titles) say "Artistic Landscape Features" — the descriptions on those 3 videos should
  be corrected on YouTube. The page uses the correct "Artistic Landscape Features."

## Open Decisions To Track Later
- **PENDING OWNER:** confirm `lawnandlandmarketingreviews.com` links back to the main site (reviews
  cross-link strategy); review screenshots still welcome to grow the screenshot wall.
- **PENDING OWNER:** real headshots for **all 10 team members** (About `#team`). All cards are now
  **initials placeholders** (`.team-ph`) by owner request — the scraped `/our-team/` photos were
  unreliable (the Jez slot alone served a fired employee's photo, then a third person), so we cleared
  them all; owner is sending fresh photos. Names + titles are confirmed accurate (and in the schema).
- **Industry-page content + template** — RESOLVED 2026-06-15: the reusable framework is built and
  proven on `/industries/landscaping/` (see the dated entry above). Remaining work is rolling it to the
  other 6 industries, one at a time. Sub-question RESOLVED 2026-06-16: the `.ind-*` CSS was extracted to a
  shared `/assets/css/industry.css` after page 2 (see the dated entry above).
- **About / Contact / Resources** design direction.
- **Service-page finishing inputs** — real FAQ answers (→ add `FAQPage` schema), verified conviction
  stats, real images.
- Whether retired routes get hosting-layer redirects at launch vs. simply staying out of internal linking.


## 2026-06-21
- **Reintroduced the `/case-studies/` silo** (previously killed) to host migrated case studies, recorded here per the routing rule that intentional reintroductions need a decision. Page 1: `/case-studies/precision/`. No index page at `/case-studies/` itself yet, so its breadcrumb crumb is a non-link label.
- **Migrated the Precision Landscape Management case study** from the legacy WordPress `/precision-case-study/` onto the new design system: preserved the substance (135 to 536 calls / +297%, 98 to 360 first-time callers, 295 to 1,407 impressions, 2 to 6 sales team, 15%+ conversion, 10x+ ROI, the seven service sections, Nate's video, the sticky table of contents, the narrative arc) and rebuilt the shell.
- **Corrected a published math error:** the old page claimed impressions "grown over 475%"; 295 to 1,407 is +377% (nearly 4.8x). Standardized on +297% for calls.
- **Modernized:** AdWords to Google Ads; removed the FREE-Google-Verified-Management bar, the Ultimate Checklist lead magnet, the Service Area Expert program framing, and the "lead acceleration session" CTA. Every CTA routes to `/get-started/book-strategy-call/`.
- **Reframed the Google-Guaranteed "quote"** as plain explanatory copy rather than a statement attributed to Google (it was not a verifiable Google quote). Flagged for owner confirmation.
- **Media:** Nate's testimonial uses the YouTube click-to-play pattern (vertical Short `q--6TsFlnLI`). Headline numbers are native data viz; dashboard screenshots are clearly-labeled placeholders pending real captures (we did not embed the dated low-res WordPress screenshots).
- **Cross-linked** from the experiences hub and the lawn-care / lawn-maintenance / landscaping / outdoor-living proof cards. **Launch 301:** `/precision-case-study/` to `/case-studies/precision/`.
- (Same day, earlier) Removed the `/resources/` hub page and `/resources/private-facebook-group/` shell; the Resources nav top-level is now a non-link label and the footer Private Facebook Group link points to the external group.


## 2026-06-21 (continued) — case study hybrid template
- **Established the reusable case-study template** (`case-study-template.md`): hero -> "At a Glance" conversion unit -> sticky-ToC deep dive. Precision is page 1; clone it for future case studies.
- **Added the "At a Glance" / "The short version" block** under the hero (situation-to-outcome narrative + the single stat band + a spend-anchored ROI line + CTA + "full breakdown" hand-off), so the page serves both the 60-second skimmer and the deep reader. Moved the stat band into this block (one instance, no duplicate).
- **Swapped the testimonial to the full-length 16:9 Nate Moses video** (`ajusL5iAs0Q`, "Our Phone Doesn't Stop Ringing", from the homepage) via click-to-play, replacing the vertical short. Caption uses his real approved quote plus the precise 135 to 536 figure. ToC + heading now read "the owner" (template-generic); the caption names the person.
- **Dropped in the real proof screenshots**, pulled from the legacy WordPress case study and re-hosted under `assets/images/precision/` (website, LSA dashboard, GBP, Featured Snippet, CRM lead, Missed Call Text Back, Google reviews) with descriptive alt text. The LSA screenshot corroborates the "$250/week, 9 leads" copy. Per owner instruction: re-host on our site, do not hotlink WordPress; leave a slot blank if an image is unavailable (none were).
- **ROI line carries no dollar figure** pending an owner-confirmed spend (per directive: drop the placeholder rather than guess). The 10x ROI multiple + Nate's approval to republish remain owner actions before this indexes. VideoObject `uploadDate` set to 2026-06-19 to match the testimonial set (owner can correct to the true date).


## 2026-06-21 (update) — Precision revenue trajectory + 23x ROI + visual polish
- **Revenue trajectory added** (Results section): native ascending bar chart, $4.4M (joined) to $7.8M (year 1) to $11.2M (year 2), with an explicit **honest-attribution note** - these are company-wide results, Precision is a strong operator in its own right, and our marketing was one of the **core drivers** and the marketing partner, not the sole cause (owner's framing: make the role known without over-claiming the revenue).
- **ROI updated 10x to 23x** everywhere on the page (stat band, At-a-Glance ROI line, secondary stat, OG description, conclusion); 23x is owner-provided.
- **"The short version" block** now sits on the Twilight textured + dot-grid band (matches the homepage stats bar / `.ind-band`).
- **GBP then-to-now comparison** (4.5 stars / 43 reviews to 4.8 stars / 320+ reviews); the current-state GBP screenshot is still pending (it was shared inline, not as a hostable file).


## 2026-06-21 (update) — Rock Solid Landscape case study built
- **Built `/case-studies/rock-solid/`** into the case-study framework (cloned from the Precision reference). Rock Solid Landscape, Wauseon, OH, owner Zach Franz. An **organic/SEO-led** story (no paid ads), distinct from Precision's paid-led one.
- **Fixed the framework-flagged issues:** the old page's generic title ("Digital Marketing Blueprint for 7-Figure Businesses") + Precision's meta description -> client-specific; verified the math (+378% impressions, +466% clicks are correct); removed WordPress cruft, the FREE-Google promo bar, and the banned Gemini-generated image.
- **Revenue framing reconciled** to Zach's on-record "about $700K to over $1M" (matches the embedded video, titled "$700K to Over $1M"), with the mandatory attribution-honesty note. **Flagged for owner:** the existing site proof cards say "$1.3M" for Rock Solid; the canonical figure needs an owner decision. We used the conservative, video-matching "over $1M" and did NOT change the proof cards.
- **AI-search claim reframed** for defensibility: kept the real, Rock-Solid-specific proof (a ChatGPT screenshot naming them the top recommendation for Wauseon, OH) but dropped the "we dominate AI search" overclaim and the unprovable "thanks to our AI-EO" causation, and added a point-in-time caveat (AI answers change).
- **New reusable element:** a **month-by-month results table** (`.cs-table`) showing the GBP ramp (Months 1/3/6). Real screenshots (#1 Google ranking, ChatGPT, GBP) re-hosted under `assets/images/rock-solid/`; the two source matplotlib charts rendered natively instead.
- Cross-linked from the experiences hub + 4 industry proof cards; sitemap + 301 added. No ROI multiple (none available; the revenue trajectory is the return).


## 2026-06-21 (update) — Client Results roster page + case-study interlinking
- **Built `/client-results/`** (builder directive): a tiered "Client Results" ROSTER, nested under About (breadcrumb Home / About / Client Results; an About-dropdown nav item; NO new top-level nav, NO anchored sub-links). **Tier 1** = deep featured case studies (Precision + Rock Solid cards, exact case-study stats, "Read the full case study →"). **Tier 2** = lighter roster cards for the other named testimonial owners (Tami, Rick, Phillip, Peter, David, Tim, Greg) with qualitative blurbs (NO fabricated numbers) linking to the experiences hub.
- **Distinctness held:** Client Results = results/roster + case-study depth; Experiences = the video-and-screenshot wall. They cross-link, not duplicate.
- **Hub-and-spoke interlinking wired:** Client Results Tier 1 → case studies; experiences hub → "See all client results"; each case study's Explore → "All Client Results"; existing industry/experiences proof cards already link the case studies.
- Schema: CollectionPage + ItemList (the 2 case studies) + BreadcrumbList. Inline `.cr-*` CSS. Sitemap + nav updated. **Future trigger:** once ~4-5 full case studies exist, evaluate a dedicated `/case-studies/` index in addition to the roster.


## 2026-06-21 (update) — Rock Solid revenue figure resolved to $1.4M
- **Owner confirmed Rock Solid hit $1.4M in their first full year** (from about $700K, a clean 2x). Standardized the figure across the whole site: the Rock Solid case study (At a Glance, stat band, return line, secondary stat, the revenue bar chart now an exact 2x, conclusion, meta/OG/Article schema), the Client Results roster Tier 1 card, the 11 proof cards that previously said "$1.3M" (homepage, 8 industry pages, experiences hub, Authority program), and the landscaping/lawn-care FAQ answers (also bumped "tripled" to "more than tripled" calls to match the ~4x). Reframed "crossed seven figures" to "doubled, to $1.4M" / "first full year" where it described revenue.
- **Kept (consistent with $1.4M, not contradictory):** Zach's VideoObject keeps its real YouTube title ("...from $700K to Over $1M..."). Nearby written captions/stat copy use $1.4M so the spoken rounding does not read as a competing figure. Program-tier copy ("companies over/under $1M") is unrelated and untouched.
- Resolves the standing legacy revenue-figure mismatch flag. No before/after GBP review count for Rock Solid (owner has no historical number; the current 49 stays as the single point).

## 2026-06-21 — Service-page FAQs answered + FAQPage schema live
- Owner supplied all 40 FAQ answers via the pre-launch sheet; reviewed, tightened, and wired in.
- 7 generated services: answers live in `_content.json` as `faqAnswers` (parallel to `faqQuestions`);
  `gen_service.py` renders them and emits per-page `FAQPage` JSON-LD. website-design (template): hand-edited.
- Decisions: website-cost FAQ KEEPS the $15K–$50K range, framed as competitor/market context (not our price) —
  the one sanctioned exception to the no-pricing rule, owner-approved. Second-GBP answer reframed to the
  Google-compliant "only with a real location" path (avoids listing-suspension risk).
- 5 technical answers authored by Claude (owner-flagged): local SEO vs map pack, GBP vs local SEO,
  Google Ads vs LSA, avoiding wasted ad spend, boosting vs real campaign.
- `FAQPage` schema is now satisfied for service pages (was gated on real answers). Still pending elsewhere.

## 2026-06-21 — Conviction-stat update + case-study sign-offs/confirmations (sheet rows 6-12)
- **Google Ads conviction stat** swapped from "$2 profit per $1 (Google Economic Impact)" to L&L's own
  result: "8-12%" typical campaign conversion rate vs a ~3-6% industry average (owner direction). Lead/sub
  updated; statSource note = "Lawn & Land client averages" (internal only, not rendered). Other 6 service
  conviction stats confirmed accurate by owner.
- **Case-study sign-offs RECEIVED:** Precision + Rock Solid owners approved names/numbers/video/screenshots
  (cleared to index at launch). Precision LSA figures ($250/wk, 9 leads) confirmed correct.
- **From The Ground Up** ($1.8M to $3.2M) numbers confirmed; case study NOT yet built (awaiting owner go-ahead).
- **GHL calendar** confirmed at 20 minutes (matches site copy; no change needed).

## 2026-06-21 — og:image share graphic added sitewide
- Owner-provided 1200x630 brand card ("digital marketing built for the green industry" + logo),
  optimized to a 164KB JPEG at `assets/images/og-share.jpg`. Wired `og:image` (+ width/height/alt)
  and `twitter:image` into all 33 indexable pages (website-design template -> 7 generated; sitewide
  insert for the rest). Absolute URL is staging (`new.lawnlab.dev`); flips to production at launch
  alongside the canonicals/og:url. Same graphic on every page (one brand card). Remaining launch SEO
  task: `robots.txt` + the staging->production domain flip.

## 2026-06-21 — Heading-overflow collision fix (widow-guard) + multi-device walkthrough
- BUG (reported on the gbp-management FAQ): the widow-guard (main.js) glued the last two words of
  every heading with a non-breaking space; for "GBP Management, answered." that made "Management,
  answered." one unbreakable ~401px unit, wider than the 300px FAQ heading column, so it overflowed
  and collided with the FAQ cards (and stranded "GBP" alone on line 1).
- FIX (systemic, all headings): the widow-guard now REVERTS the glue whenever it makes a heading
  wider than its box (scrollWidth > clientWidth) -> wraps naturally instead of overflowing. Re-runs
  debounced on resize, so the no-overflow guarantee holds at any window width, not just load width.
- FAQ heading column widened 300px -> 350px (gap 64 -> 56) so medium service names fit the intended
  2-line break ("GBP Management," / "answered."). 7/8 names wrap 1-2 clean lines; Reputation
  Management (longest, 411px) takes 3; none overflow.
- WALKTHROUGH: overflow detector run across the major layouts (homepage, service + hub, industry,
  program, about, contact, case study, client-results, experiences) at mobile 375 / tablet 768 /
  desktop 1440. Zero collisions or horizontal overflow found anywhere besides the now-fixed FAQ.
- Versions: main.js v54->55, service-page.css v3->4 (bumped sitewide).

## 2026-06-22 — Repo cleanup / optimization pass
- Image optimization: the 3 hero backgrounds (team-hero, reviews-hero, programs-hero — the last is the
  default hero on ~30 pages) were 2816px / ~1.9MB each; resized to 1760px + recompressed (q70, dark-
  overlaid so imperceptible) -> ~684KB each. matt-foreman.jpg 1200x1800/524KB -> 933x1400/380KB. Total
  ~3.9MB trimmed off the deploy. Logos (logo-badge.svg 1MB, logo-horizontal.svg 632KB) are base64
  rasters in an SVG wrapper — left untouched (on every page; re-exporting risks breaking branding;
  flagged to owner). Case-study screenshots left as-is.
- Docs brought current: README + build-status + service-page-template now reflect that FAQ answers +
  FAQPage schema, conviction stats, og:image, team headshots, and case-study sign-offs all landed
  2026-06-21; only placeholder images + robots.txt + the staging->production flip remain.
- Removed stray .DS_Store; build --check green, generator regenerate-clean, 0 broken links, 0
  [NEEDS YOUR INPUT] / em-dashes / emoji.
- NOTE: .git history is ~102MB (large image blobs committed before .gitignore existed). Not rewritten
  (force-push would disrupt the Vercel/GitHub integration); optional future cleanup via BFG if desired.

## 2026-06-22 — Blog built (index + post template) + first real post migrated
- The shelved article.css was re-oriented (was sidebar-left/TOC -> now content-left/sidebar-right) and
  is now the blog stylesheet. Two page types: blog INDEX (/resources/blog/, card grid + category filter,
  .blog-* classes) and individual POST (.article-* classes: hero, two-column, sticky right sidebar with
  About-the-Author + the contact .cform [GHL webhook] + related; pull-quote, lime callout, FAQ, CTA).
- Author = Matt Foreman; avatar at assets/images/matt-author.jpg (face-cropped from matt-stage-speaker.jpg).
- First real post migrated as the populated demo: "Why Landscaping SEO Gets Traffic But Not Qualified
  Leads" at its REAL slug, pulled via the WordPress REST API (/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?slug=...&_fields=...).
  That REST pipeline is the clean path for the eventual 81-post import. Em-dashes converted to brand style.
- OPEN: blog currently lives at /resources/blog/; may move to /blog/ at import to preserve the 81 existing
  /blog/<slug>/ URLs exactly. The other 80 posts are NOT yet imported (deferred by owner).

- Author/EEAT system (2026-06-22): built from the owner's directive. /author/matt-foreman/ hub
  (indexable; photo + long bio + podcast/book/LinkedIn/L&L profile pills + "Articles by Matt Foreman"
  archive grid; Person + Book + ProfilePage @graph). Every article: byline name links to the author
  page, a reusable "About the author" end block (short bio), sidebar trimmed to a teaser. Each article's
  BlogPosting sets author -> #matt-foreman (by @id, not a string) + publisher -> #organization; the Person
  @id is the SAME #matt-foreman as the About page (one unified entity). The eventual 81-post import MUST
  stamp the byline link + end block + BlogPosting schema into every post. Author CSS in article.css (v=3);
  em-dash-free. OWNER TO CONFIRM (general copy is live now, do not block): named award(s)+year, named
  conferences, Matt's PERSONAL LinkedIn (sameAs currently uses the L&L company LinkedIn as a stand-in).

- Blog framework follow-up (2026-06-22, from the EEAT auditor review): added gen_blog_schema.py, a
  reusable + idempotent generator that injects FAQPage JSON-LD into each blog post from its visible
  .article-faq Q&A (run after writing/importing posts). Added FAQPage to the live article (4 Q&A, text
  matches the visible FAQ). Set sample-post to robots noindex,follow (template/filler; the related-article
  + author-archive links point to it as placeholders until real posts exist -- resolve those at import).
  Verified all three EEAT schema connections resolve: author-page Person #matt-foreman; article BlogPosting
  author by @id == that Person (not a string); FAQPage matches the visible FAQ. Call-duration: the site is
  uniformly 20-minute (no 30-min exists anywhere); the filler article CTA was rewritten to a 20-minute strategy call. SKIPPED per owner: the article's generic body copy (intentional filler until the import).

## 2026-06-23 — Industry FAQ accuracy pass · program images · exclusive accordion · service-scope guardrail
- **Exclusive FAQ accordion (industry pages):** `/industries/*` FAQs use native `<details>`, which open
  independently (all could be open at once). Added a handler in `main.js` that closes sibling `<details>`
  when one opens (one open at a time), scoped to `.ind-faq > details`; JS-off degrades to native independent
  toggles. Bumped `main.js?v=56` sitewide. Verified live.
- **Program "Why us" images landed** (first real images dropped into placeholders): `/programs/growth/`
  (`assets/images/growth-why.jpg`, a real sod/hardscape job site) and `/programs/authority/`
  (`assets/images/authority-why.jpg`, a podcast/video-call still). Both optimized to 1200x900 (~250KB) with
  EXIF/GPS stripped (source phone photos carried GPS). Process: pull from owner's Drive -> resize/compress
  (Pillow) -> strip metadata -> swap the `.why-ph` placeholder contents for `<img style="...object-fit:cover">`.
- **Industry FAQ rewrite — POV correction + service-scope accuracy (owner review).** Two systemic problems
  found: (a) some questions were written in the CONTRACTOR's voice (pricing a job, "when should I clear my
  land", permits/burning) instead of as questions a contractor asks their MARKETING agency; (b) copy
  hallucinated services L&L does NOT offer (running renewals, rebooking, reactivating customers, deposits,
  waitlists/overflow, takedown, social-media management, running the client's email list). Fixed per page,
  visible copy + FAQPage JSON-LD kept in lockstep, em-dash-free:
  - **landscaping:** new-website (you WILL get a new site, no Frankenstein builds), spring-timing (winter =
    pre-positioning, dropped the unrealistic "selling installs in Dec/Jan"), slow-season (realistic, then the
    competitors-coast + SEO-lead-time opportunity).
  - **outdoor-living:** lead-gen reframed to owning your leads via Google + AI search (dropped Houzz); spring
    now embraces paid (high intent = lowest CPA / highest ROI) + always-on + not set-and-forget; portfolio
    answer lists real channels (website, GBP, press releases, paid ads — NO social mgmt). Also fixed the
    comparison-table row that claimed we build Houzz/Instagram.
  - **lawn-care:** spring-rush split by channel (SEO a season ahead since it is slow to compound; paid ads
    ~1-2 weeks pre-season to build momentum + let learning settle; hold ads through peak); retention answer
    no longer implies L&L runs the client's renewals (renewal/prepay systems are theirs; our job is the
    marketing around them).
  - **lawn-maintenance:** spring-rush aligned to the channel-split strategy; REMOVED the question "What
    happens to the leads after they come in?"; commercial/HOA reframed as an honest hybrid (relationships are
    theirs to build, the research experience — site / branding / reputation / reviews — is ours).
  - **land-clearing + excavation:** FULL FAQ rewrites (all 7 questions each) from the marketing-agency POV;
    every contractor-voice question killed.
  - **holiday-lighting:** FULL PAGE revisit. The "we do the client's sales/ops" hallucination ran through the
    meta tags, schema description, intro lede, comparison table, the season module, BOTH service cards
    (CRM + AI), the 5-step, the proof + testimonial intros, the Growth program card, and the FAQ — all
    reworked to what L&L actually does (demand-gen Meta ads, web/SEO/GBP presence, lead capture +
    speed-to-lead, reputation/reviews, permanent-lighting marketing). Repositioned the whole page around the
    OFF-SEASON gap-filler thesis for lawn/landscape companies (esp. northern winters): "if you're not
    offering holiday lighting yet, you should, and here's how we market it." New FAQ leads with that + a
    dedicated Meta ads question (Meta is the emphasized channel — best ROI for this trade).
- **NEW GUARDRAIL — owner's #1 accuracy rule (now in repo + agent memory):** website copy may claim ONLY
  L&L's 8 real services (Website Design, Local SEO, Google Ads, Meta Ads, GBP Management, Your AI Partner /
  AI search, Reputation Management, CRM & Automation = lead capture + speed-to-lead follow-up). NEVER imply
  L&L does the client's sales, renewals, rebooking, deposits, waitlists, social-media management, or email
  list. Frame relationships + renewals as the client's; L&L's role is the marketing around them. Industry-page
  FAQs answer questions a contractor asks their marketing agency, never customer-to-contractor questions.
  When auditing, scan the WHOLE page (meta description, OG/Twitter tags, JSON-LD, service cards, modules),
  not just the visible FAQ — the overreach hides everywhere.
- **OPEN — accuracy sweep (next session):** the same service-scope overreach still lives in BODY copy on
  other pages. Confirmed still-to-fix: **lawn-care** (comparison rows "Sells prepay and renewals" +
  "Protects retention... renewals", the seasonal "Sell prepay & renewals" module, 5-step "automated
  follow-up and renewals... all run for you", CRM card "renewal reminders") and **outdoor-living** (the
  "Knows your season" comparison row + the "How long until I see results?" FAQ still lean on the OLD
  "don't advertise in spring" stance, now contradicting the new spring-positive Q2). Sweep the remaining
  industry + program/service pages for the same pattern.
- **Images (2026-06-23, later):** all 8 `/industries/*` intro placeholders (`.ind-ph`) now hold real
  owner-provided photos (`assets/images/<industry>-intro.jpg`): landscaping, lawn-care, lawn-maintenance,
  outdoor-living, land-clearing, excavation, septic-installation, holiday-lighting. Each PNG -> 1400x788
  JPEG (~240-350KB), EXIF/GPS stripped, shown in the template 4:3 box via object-fit:cover (center-cropped
  on desktop, full 16:9 on mobile). Source: the owner's shared Drive folder, one file named per page. (Plus
  the two `/programs/*` "Why us" images earlier the same day.) Remaining placeholders: homepage CTA +
  service-page screenshots.
