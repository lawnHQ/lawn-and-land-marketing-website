# Lawn & Land Marketing — Website

Orientation for a fresh session. Read this first, then `docs/website-source-of-truth/`.
Last updated: 2026-06-15.

## What this is
The future public website for **Lawn & Land Marketing** — a digital-marketing agency working
**exclusively with green-industry / lawn care & landscaping companies**. Static, multi-page,
hand-built HTML/CSS/JS (no framework). Final home: **lawnandlandmarketing.com** —
**NOT launched yet**; we build and review on staging.

- **Live staging:** https://new.lawnlab.dev — and the Vercel project domain
  https://lawnland-site.vercel.app (same deploy). Both always reflect `main`.
- **Deploy:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) → Vercel
  production. Takes ~1–2 min. (Vercel also auto-creates auth-protected previews per branch.)
- **Branches:** all progress lives on `main`; the working branch `site-foundation` is kept
  in sync with it — push to **both** (`origin site-foundation` then `origin site-foundation:main`).
- **Cache-bust versions in use:** `styles.css?v=138`, `main.js?v=53`, `service-page.css?v=3`.

## Status — what's DONE (developed)
- **Homepage** (`/`) — the benchmark page. Flow (reordered for conversion): hero (YouTube
  click-to-play facade) → stats → "Industries We Serve" grid → services → **mini case-study
  proof row** (3 real clients with photos + before→after numbers) → programs → "Why L&L" →
  testimonials (gold-glow 5-star) → **"Trusted By" logo marquee on the Twilight dot-grid band**
  → FAQ (+ `FAQPage` schema) → Twilight CTA. The unfinished Blog was pulled from nav + flow.
- **All 8 `/marketing-services/*` detail pages** — built on a locked, **generated** template:
  `website-design`, `local-seo`, `google-ads`, `meta-ads`, `gbp-management`, `your-ai-partner`,
  `reputation-management`, `automation`. Per page: hero → conviction stat → showcase + labeled
  image placeholder → "What's included" (purple featured card + 7 Lucide cards) → reversed
  showcase → FAQ → Twilight CTA. `Service` JSON-LD each.
- **Marketing-services HUB** (`/marketing-services/`) — built, hand-built SEO silo ("one machine"
  framing, 4 featured services + a wrap-up grid linking all 8, `ItemList` schema).
- **Growth Program page** (`/programs/growth/`) — **built**; the first finished program page.
  Lean, Hormozi-style, built entirely from the real contract (no pricing, no invented facts):
  `simple-hero` + breadcrumb → "Sound familiar?" 3 red pain cards → **"What you get" four-pillar
  section on the Twilight textured band** (World-Class Website / Local SEO / Google-LSA / CRM &
  Lead Mgmt) → "Why us" two-column (image placeholder left, copy right) → Twilight CTA.
  `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD, OG + Twitter card.
- **Authority Program page** (`/programs/authority/`) — **built**; the flagship. Same lean DNA as
  Growth, elevated for established **7-figure+** companies ("own your market"): hero → 3 pain cards →
  Twilight four-pillar "domination" band → full "everything included" deliverables grid → value play
  ("a whole team for less than one hire") → **Roadmap to Domination** timeline → partnership +
  credibility two-column (50+ clients, $300K–$14M+, 97% retention, NALP) → Twilight CTA. Built from
  the contract + pitch deck. `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD, OG + Twitter. No pricing.
- **Programs hub** (`/programs/`) — a simple two-program window: hero + Growth (six-figure) and
  Authority (seven-figure) cards that link into each program, plus a "not sure which?" CTA.
- **Landscaping industry page** (`/industries/landscaping/`) — **built**; the first of 8 and the
  **reusable industry-page template**. Hero + trust strip → answer-first definition (two-column) →
  specialist-vs-generalist comparison table → **demand-cycle module** ("ahead of the seasons", four
  season cards on the Twilight band — the signature insight; non-seasonal trades use a demand-mode layout) →
  service grid (8, incl. the Twilight AI standout) → 5-step process → real proof cases + **video
  testimonials** → Growth/Authority program-fit → **visible FAQ accordion + FAQPage schema** → Twilight
  CTA. Engineered for SEO + GEO + EEAT (one keyword H1, question H2s, answer-first openers, `@graph`
  JSON-LD, real proof only). The reusable `.ind-*` CSS is scoped in the page's `<style>`; copy it per page
  for industries 2–8. Full spec: `docs/website-source-of-truth/industry-page-template.md`.
- **Universal header + footer** via `build.py` (edit `_header.html` / `_footer.html`; stamps everywhere).
  Nav Programs submenu icons: sprout (Growth), trophy (Authority).
- **The `.hl` Twilight highlight** — the signature one-impact-phrase marker (skewed −11° `#6837EF`
  swipe behind the lower portion of a phrase, white text, sharp edges). Defined in `styles.css`;
  also locked into the brand kit (see Related assets). Use sparingly — one phrase per surface.

## Status — what's NOT done (shells / next up)
- **7 remaining industry pages** (`/industries/*`) — **the current big build.** `landscaping` is **built**
  and is the locked template (see DONE above). Still **shells** (header + hero + CTA only): `lawn-care`,
  `lawn-maintenance`, `outdoor-living`, `land-clearing`, `excavation`, `septic-services`,
  `holiday-lighting`. Roll the Landscaping framework to each — one at a time (owner's preference) — with
  its own seasonality, services emphasis, comparison rows, proof framing, and FAQ. The canonical 8 are LOCKED.
- **About, Contact, Resources/\*** — shells.
- The 8 service pages still need three owner inputs to be final: real FAQ answers (→ then add
  `FAQPage` schema), verified conviction stats, and real images for the labeled placeholders.

## How the site is built (tooling)
- **Header/footer:** edit `_header.html` / `_footer.html`, then `python3 build.py` (verify with
  `python3 build.py --check`). Vercel runs `build.py` on every deploy (see `vercel.json`).
- **Service pages are GENERATED:** edit copy in **`_content.json`** (one object per service) →
  `python3 gen_service.py` (renders each `/marketing-services/<slug>/index.html` from the
  `website-design` page as the structural template; all internal links generated by construction
  so they can't drift) → `python3 build.py`. **Don't hand-edit generated service HTML.** Full
  spec: `docs/website-source-of-truth/service-page-template.md`.
- **Program / industry / other pages are HAND-BUILT** (not generated). They reuse the same
  `styles.css` + `service-page.css` (`svc-*`, `simple-hero`, `svc-cta`) classes for consistency.
- **Styles:** `assets/css/styles.css` (global, nav, `.hl`) + `assets/css/service-page.css` (`svc-*`).
  Bump the `?v=` query **sitewide** when a CSS file changes. One-liner:
  `find . -name "*.html" -not -path "./.git/*" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -E 's/styles\.css\?v=[0-9]+/styles.css?v=NN/g'`

## Brand & content rules (non-negotiable — owner reviews for these)
- **Icons:** Lucide stroke SVGs only (1.75 weight, round caps, `currentColor`). NEVER emoji or
  unicode glyphs as icons.
- **Twilight `#6837EF` (purple) NEVER blends with green.** Premium standalone accent only: the
  purple featured card, the CTA spotlight + dot-grid band, the `.hl` highlight. Greens: Limeade
  `#ACE71D`, Gator `#5DCA49`. Dark base `#07100A`.
- **No pricing anywhere** on the site — every CTA routes to the free strategy call
  (`/get-started/book-strategy-call/`).
- **No invented facts.** Anything unverifiable is a clearly-marked placeholder. Conviction stats
  must be REAL + sourced (`statSource` in `_content.json`). FAQ answers stay `[NEEDS YOUR INPUT]`
  until the owner supplies them; `FAQPage` schema is added only once answers are real.
- **Keyword variants:** lead with the page's primary term, weave 2–3 natural variants. No stuffing.
- **City/county names** always carry a 2-letter state code ("Tampa, FL"), Title Case.
- **The two program avatars are DIFFERENT — don't conflate them:**
  - **Growth** ($400K–$1M, "six-figure"): grew offline on referrals/repeat work, hit the ceiling,
    nearly invisible online, trying to get FOUND for the first time → foundation / get-found story.
  - **Authority** (7-figure+): already doing some online marketing → omnipresent / dominate-the-market
    story. The vendor-sprawl + agency-scar-tissue + "optimize what exists" pains belong HERE, not Growth.

## SEO conventions
- Per page: unique `<title>`, meta description (~155 chars), `canonical`, Open Graph + Twitter card.
  (`og:image` / share graphics are a launch task — not added yet.)
- Schema: `Service` on service pages + Growth; `BreadcrumbList` where there's a visible breadcrumb;
  `FAQPage` only when the answers are real. Homepage carries `MarketingAgency`/Organization +
  `WebSite` + `FAQPage`.
- **Schema uses the production domain** (`lawnandlandmarketing.com`) even though page **canonicals
  still point to staging** (`new.lawnlab.dev`). The canonical flip is a single launch-time find/replace.

## Launch checklist (later — `docs/website-source-of-truth/seo-launch-checklist.md`)
Flip all `new.lawnlab.dev` → `lawnandlandmarketing.com` (canonicals + `og:url`); add `og:image`
share graphics; keep the real **`sitemap.xml`** current (rebuilt 2026-06-15 to the real routes —
no killed routes); add `robots.txt`; verify the service-page conviction stats; land real FAQ
answers + `FAQPage` schema; drop real images into placeholders. **Don't deploy to the production
domain until launch.**

## Working with the owner (Matt)
Product-minded, not a deep engineer — explain **outcomes**, not git/Vercel/CLI/deploy mechanics
(handle those quietly). He reviews visible changes on the **live URL** (hard-refresh after a push;
deploys take ~1–2 min). In-tool screenshots don't render well for him.
